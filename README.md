# markoText: Bag of Words Markov Chain

markoText is a Python-based story generator that leverages a Bag of Words Markov Chain model to create new text based on an input story or text corpus. This program generates new narratives by predicting the next word in a sequence based on the words that came before it. The Markov Chain model is trained on an input text file, learning the statistical probabilities of transitions between words. By using this trained model, the program can generate new and unique text that mimics the style and structure of the original input.

## Features

- **Training with Custom Text:** Train a Markov model from any text file (e.g., stories, books).
- **Customizable n-Grams:** Adjust the n-gram size to control the complexity of word prediction.
- **Story Generation:** Generate text starting from a user-defined state and generate a specific number of words.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `re` and `random` modules (standard library)

## Running the Program

### Step 1: Prepare the Text File
Ensure you have a text file that contains the story or text you'd like to train the model on. This file should be plain text (e.g., `.txt` format).

### Step 2: Run the Program

Open a terminal and run the program using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 3: Command Line Arguments

You will need to provide the following arguments when running the program:

- **Story Path (`story_path`)**: The path to the text file you want to use for training the model.
- **N-Gram Size (`n_gram`)**: The number of words to consider when predicting the next word in the sequence. This value will determine the complexity of the model (e.g., 1 for unigram, 2 for bigram, etc.).
- **Starting State (`state`)**: The word or phrase where the generated story should start. This is the seed for the text generation.
- **Number of Words to Generate (`count`)**: The number of words you want the generated story to contain.

## Usage

### Example Story File (`data/holmes.txt`):

```
(venv) kanavgoyal@MacBook-Pro markoText % cd src/
(venv) kanavgoyal@MacBook-Pro src % python3 main.py 
enter story path: ../data/holmes.txt
enter n-gram: 2
number of states: 215,543 in a 2-gram model
enter starting state: THE GAME
enter number of words to generate: 128

## Dataset

The sample text used for training in markoText is derived from the Sherlock Holmes series by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. These classic works, which are available in the public domain, provide a rich and diverse corpus ideal for text-based experimentation. For access to the complete collection of Sherlock Holmes stories, visit [The Complete Sherlock Holmes](https://sherlock-holm.es/), a comprehensive resource for fans and researchers of Doyle's legendary detective series.

## Conclusion

markoText is a powerful tool for generating creative text based on a given corpus using the Bag of Words Markov Chain model. Whether youâ€™re interested in generating new stories, experimenting with word patterns, or creating unique content for writing or creative projects, this tool offers flexibility and control over how the text is generated. By adjusting the n-gram size and starting state, you can explore a wide range of text generation possibilities, from simple random sequences to more structured and coherent stories. The more diverse and extensive the training corpus, the richer and more varied the generated text will be.

With markoText, you can bring a new level of interactivity and creativity to any text-based project.
